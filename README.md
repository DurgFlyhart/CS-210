1. The Airgead program is intended to let a client predict there future savings. It took the initial investment, monthly deposit, and interest rate to show thier 5 year growth.
2. I think the thing I did best was keeping the main function clean and clear. I used functions to allow the least amount of code possible in the main() funcion.
3. To clean up my code I would of moved the functions that where in main.cpp to either the Airgead class or make another one.
   This would better compartamintalize the code and not show to much to people working out of main.
4. Building different functions to handle small tasks can be difficult. It can be very easy to let them baloon and do to much. AI is a great tool to help quickly check
   your code. If you are running into an error with what you wrote and can't find the solutin. Pasting what you have into AI can point you in the right direction to fix it.
5. Creating a class is a very important part of coding and I will be able to use this in all of my code in the future.
6. I made sure to commit on any line that needed some explanation. This would allow people to better understand my thought process and work on my code.
